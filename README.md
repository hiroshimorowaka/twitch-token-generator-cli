# Twitch Token Generator CLI

Node version: lts/iron

A dead-simple Twitch Token Generator Tool

You can revoke or generate a token without the need for HTTP request apps or suspicious websites

You can clone the project and run it on your own machine. I used bun in the project to use Typescript without transpiling, but if you use NodeJS, you can build the project and run it with the command `npm run build`.

You can build your own version for Windows using `npm run build:windows`

And that's it, enjoy!
